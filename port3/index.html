                <p>
                    Hello! My name is Benjamin and I'm a highly motivated aspiring software-engineer. I've always loved to make things. When I was a kid, I was always into crafts like origami, legos, building computers, and even wood-working. When I took my first programming class in high school, I fell in love with building projects I'm passionate about.
                </p>

                <p>
                    These days, I'm a student, but I also love creating outside of classes. This website is a great example! I'm currently self-teaching myself front-end technologies that are not taught in school, in an effort to become a well rounded full-stack developer.
                </p>

                        Seveneightsix was my very first Hackathon project. It is a Python web application that allows web developers to view the carbon emission of their website. Without any front-end experience before this project, I learned basic HTML, CSS, and using Flask with Jinja2 templates. This project recieved the <b>"Best Eco-Friendly Hack"</b> award for HackViolet 2023. <a href="https://devpost.com/software/tbd-quapmb">Check out the Devpost!</a>

                    <h2><b>Venmo Sheets</b></h2>
                    <p>
                        During my freshman year at Virgina Tech, I served as the Freshman Represenatative for the Chinese American Society. I noticed that all of our club dues, merchandise, event payments, etc. were all taken through Venmo. Someone would then have to go through the Venmo account, check each transaction manually, and transfer the data to a spreadsheet to keep track of payments. I decided to build a Python script that would automate this process. Built using venmo-api and Google Cloud, this script will add new incoming payments to a running list on Google Sheets.

                    <h2><b>Work Calendar</b></h2>
                    <p>
                        My very first part-time job did not have a set schedule, but was instead released on a bi-weekly basis. I'm a very organized person, so I would create Google Calendar events for each shift. However, doing this every two weeks was very tedious and boring, so I decided to create a Python script to automate that process for me. This script webscrapes my shift data, and creates respective calendar events. Built with Selenium and Google Calendar API.

                        This was the final project for my CS2114: Data Structures and Algorithms class. It is an interactive dashboard of creator data, with multiple sorting options. These include: by name, by traditional and reach engagement rates, and filtering by month or quarter. Built in Java.
